    "| Dependency Management | Resolves dependencies only within python packages. If two packages require incompatible versions of the same dependency, pip may install conflicting ones creating a dependency hell | Has a more powerful dependency resolver. Manages both python and non-python dependencies. |\n",
    "| Installation Scope | Always installs into the current Python environment | Works at environment level. We can specify the env to install the package with conda install -n/-p packagename |\n",
    "| Performance | Downloads source distributions (sdist) and compiles if wheels are not available. Can be slow, especially for heavy packages like scipy | Distributes precompiled binaries. Must faster to install |\n",

    "### Best Practices to select between pip install and conda install\n",
    "- Use conda install whenever possible\n",
    "- Use pip install only when a package is not available on conda channels\n",
    "- Use pip install when we are not using conda at all \n",
    "- Use pip install when we want the latest releases that are not available on conda channels\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Dependency Hell\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Hell happens when installing one package breaks another package because they require incompatible versions of the same dependency. Pip always install one package at a time and it doesn't solve for the whole dependency tree before installing. Hence we may end up with a mix of packages that won't work together. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "- Package A requires numpy>=1.23 <1.24\n",
    "- Package B requires numpy>=1.25\n",
    "\n",
    "When we install both Package A and B, \n",
    "- pip may install Package A first which pulls in numpy 1.23.\n",
    "- pip would then install Package B which upgrades numpy to 1.25\n",
    "- Now A is broken because it cannot work with numpy 1.25\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to avoid dependency hell with pip\n",
    "- If possible, use conda. \n",
    "- Use virtual environments and isolate dependencies as per project. \n",
    "- Install from a requirements.txt file with pinned versions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numpy==1.23.5\n",
    "pandas=2.0.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How conda avoids dependency hell\n",
    "- When we install packages using conda install, conda doesn't install the packages one by one. \n",
    "- Instead, it looks at the dependency tree of all requested packages, plus what's already installed in the environement. \n",
    "- It then tries to find a set of versions that work together. \n",
    "- If it can't, it refuses to install and gives us a conflict error instead of silently breaking things. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Channels\n",
    "A channel is a package repository (a URL) that conda searches when installing a package. \n",
    "- By default, conda looks at the defaults channel (maintained by Anaconda)\n",
    "- To pick a particular channel, we need to add the -c parameter. If we say conda install -c conda-forge numpy, it will install the numpy package from conda-forge. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Channel priority\n",
    "If we have multiple channels configured, conda will look at our channel list (in order of priority) and try to find a set of dependencies that work together. If channel_priority is set to strict, conda will only install from the higest priority channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda Forge\n",
    "- conda-forge is a community-led collection of conda packages. \n",
    "- It is not maintained by Anaconda. Instead, thousands of contributors keep it up-to-date. \n",
    "- All packages are built automatically using a continuous integration CI system and made available through the conda-forge channel. \n",
    "- It contains more packages compared to the defaults conda channel. \n",
    "- conda-forge packages are often updated much sooner than the defaults channel. If we want the latest version of something like pandas, scipy or pytorch, conda-forge usually has it first.\n",
    "- It supports Cross-platform consistency. Packages are built for Linux, Mac and Windows in a standardized way. It helps ensure our environment works the same across machines. "
